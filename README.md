<h3>DINDIN ANGULAR-APPLICATION</h3>

DINDIN is a SPA developed with Angular. 
DINDIN is in short a website where a user can find restaurants to eat at based on three criteria: Location (zip), Cuisine and Budget. An user with an account can also <i>like</i> multiple restaurants thereby saving them in his account. This function is working but at the moment there is only an admin account, and user creation is not implemented yet. Contact me to get access to an account (fahadalisajad@hotmail.com)
